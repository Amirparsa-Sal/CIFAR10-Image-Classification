# CIFAR10-Image-Classification

This is my first project of computational intelligence cource at AUT.  
In this project, I implemented a general MLP neural network to classify CIFAR10 dataset images.  
The network is implemented in vectorized and non-vectorized form to calculate the speedup between this two aproach.
